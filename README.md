# Mission-to-Mars
The purpose of this challenge is to use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape the images and titles of the Mars Hemispheres, store them in a Mongo database, and use a web application to create a page to view the scraped data. After the page was created,  I used bootstrap to change the apperance of it. I added an image and changed the color of the headers and background.
